You will need the following line on the bottom of your CSS, then:

@media screen and (min-width: 60em) {

    }


----Start by reading my feedback from previous assignments, so you don’t make the same mistakes.

----If you haven’t yet, you’ll need to include the following rule in your CSS:
body {
font-family: sans-serif;
}

----You also need the following rule in your CSS:
div.container {
position: relative;
min-height: 100vh;
}
(Although, you should have it already.)

----To make each link to change color when it’s the selected page, give a class selected to its li in HTML, and use nav ul li.selected a { } as the selector of a new rule in CSS. (This rule doesn’t need to be in the media query.) It’s not a hover style.

----Use an <article> element in your about.html and contact.html, then style it with light blue in CSS.

----Include on the media query only what’s absolute necessary. (I only used three rules and a total of seven declarations in the media query.)

When you’re done, use tools such as FreeFormatter, HTML Formatter, or Code Beautify to organize your HTML code.
